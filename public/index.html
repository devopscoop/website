                    Our purpose is to create and support evolving, opinionated, infrastructure as code (IaC) repositories based on free, libre, open source software (FOSS) that can be used to build production-ready, compliant, secure infrastructure.

                <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
                <p>
                    We don't take VC money - this is not a profit-seeking organization - this is a cooperative of software engineers building good software together because <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/apes-together-strong" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apes together strong</a>.

                <h2>Our Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    The goal is to build and maintain repositories that we fork and regularly pull from. We want to enable small DevOps teams to build amazing infra and receive the support, experience, and updates from the entire Cooperative.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We want to shift organizations away from proprietary, Big Tech vendor lock-in and enshittification, and drive adoption of free, decentralized, self-hostable solutions that respect users' privacy. We recognize that not everyone can abandon AWS, Google, Cloudflare, and the rest, but we will do our part to provide alternative options and nudge our community towards more ethical infrastructure.
