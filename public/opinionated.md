# Opinionated

One of our founding principles is to provide opinioned code. (TODO: Why?)

There is no "right" or "best" way to do something, there are only opinions on how things should be done.




Often those opinions are, "do it this way because":
* tradition: that's how we've always done it. Change is hard. Don't rock the boat.
* 


Our code is shaped by our experience. When we work on a project, we often go through several stages (not necessarily in this order):

* Tradition: we often start by doing things the way that we've done them before. Copy old code and patterns. As new people join, they either follow the pattern, or they innovate, and the pattern either gets stronger or fractures.
* Experimentation: try some new greenfield code/product/framework/platform that we're always want to try. This is usually very inspirational, but it can slow us down.

How do we form opinions at devops.coop?
* write opinions in the form of social media posts, watch the discussion, and promote the most popular ones?
* Use https://www.kialo.com/
* Have each user write normalized, YAML formatted opinions in a filename named after the user and then just cat them all together, sort, and uniq -c to see what the zeitgeist is?
* Write PRs and get majority approval? What happens to all of the discussion in a PR? It's nice to see how an opinion was formed...
