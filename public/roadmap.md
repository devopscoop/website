# Roadmap

1. Write mission, vision, strategy. Or just expand the purpose. Explain what problem we're trying to solve. -- open source is great, but there's no openIaC - infrastructure is typically concealed in private repos. 


1. Collect generic reusable code to build a Kubernetes cluster.
Collect utility scripts and tools and cheatsheets.
