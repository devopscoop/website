SCM:

Does this need to be said? Looks like maybe GitLab doesn't do sub-repos anymore?
	SCM platform repo structure should be flat, because not all SCM platforms support sub-directories (looking at you GitHub.) For example, use "devopscoop/app-frontend" and "devopscoop/app-backend" instead of "devopscoop/app/frontend" and "devopscoop/app/backend".

# TODO: is this true?
Avoid assigning git repo privileges per directory or with CODEOWNERS, because not all SCM platforms support it. 

terraform code:

There should be one set of terraform code per AWS account to control account-level things like Terraform buckets and DynamoDB.
Each git repository should have one pipeline, because KISS.
Each set of per-account terraform code should be in a separate git repo, because PoLP.



Environments:

There should be one set of terraform code per deployhment environment, because PoLP.



per eks cluster code?
